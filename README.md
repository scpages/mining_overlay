# SC Mining Overlay

A real-time Star Citizen mining assistant. It watches your screen while you mine, reads the Resource Signature (RS) value from your HUD automatically, and identifies what resource it is — including how many nodes are in the cluster. The last 5 unique confirmed readings are kept on screen so you can track what you've scanned.

Inspired by [rainbowramen.github.io/sc-mining-hud](https://rainbowramen.github.io/sc-mining-hud/) — this is a live overlay version that reads your HUD automatically so you never have to type anything.

> **Work in progress** — this tool is still in development and not yet finished. It has only been tested on the **DRAKE Golem** ship. Other ships, resolutions, or HUD layouts may not work correctly. Feedback and bug reports are welcome.

## Install — step by step

You only need to do this once.

### 1. Download the overlay

Click the green **Code** button on this page → **Download ZIP** → extract the folder somewhere (e.g. your Desktop).

### 2. Install Python

Go to [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version.

**Important:** on the first screen of the installer, tick **"Add Python to PATH"** before clicking Install.

### 3. Install Tesseract OCR

Go to [this link](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and download the Windows installer.

Run it and keep all the default options — just click Next through everything.

### 4. Run the overlay

Open the extracted folder and double-click **`launch.bat`**.

It will automatically check that everything is installed and install any missing Python packages. Once all checks pass, the console disappears and the overlay appears on your screen.

## How to use it

- Point your mining laser at a rock — when the RS value appears in your HUD, the overlay identifies the resource automatically
- Only confirmed matches are shown — if the reading doesn't match any known resource exactly, it is ignored
- The last 5 unique confirmed readings are shown, newest at the top, older ones faded
- If a reading could match more than one resource, all possibilities are listed on the same row
- Click the **SHIP / FPS / GROUND** button to switch mining mode
- Drag the overlay anywhere by clicking and holding it
- Close it with the **✕** button in the top right

## Configuration

All settings are in the **`config.ini`** file in the same folder as the overlay. It is created automatically the first time you run `launch.bat` — just open it in Notepad to edit.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `game_monitor` | `1` | Which monitor the game runs on |
| `overlay_monitor` | `2` | Which monitor to show the overlay on (set to `1` if single monitor) |
| `x / y / w / h` | see file | Position and size of the capture region on screen |
| `history_size` | `5` | How many readings to keep on screen |
| `max_rs` | `100000` | Readings above this value are ignored |
| `debug` | `false` | Set to `true` to save debug images while running |

The capture region is calibrated for **2560×1440** on the DRAKE Golem. If readings are wrong for your setup, run `debug_capture.py` to help tune the region values.

## Mining modes

Switch modes by clicking the button in the top-left of the overlay.

| Mode   | Use for                         |
|--------|---------------------------------|
| SHIP   | Ship mining (Prospector, MOLE)  |
| FPS    | FPS hand tool mining            |
| GROUND | Ground vehicle mining           |

The RS value in the HUD is scaled differently depending on the tool you use — this setting makes sure the calculation is correct.

| Tier | Colour | Examples                        |
|------|--------|---------------------------------|
| S    | Gold   | Quantainium, Bexalite           |

## Troubleshooting

**Nothing is detected / wrong resources showing:**
The capture region needs to match where the RS number appears on your screen. Open `config.ini` and adjust the `x`, `y`, `w`, `h` values. Run `debug_capture.py` to see what the overlay is actually reading.

**I only have one monitor:**
Open `config.ini` and set `overlay_monitor = 1`.

**The overlay appears on the wrong monitor:**
Open `config.ini` and set `game_monitor` and `overlay_monitor` to the correct numbers (1 = primary monitor).
